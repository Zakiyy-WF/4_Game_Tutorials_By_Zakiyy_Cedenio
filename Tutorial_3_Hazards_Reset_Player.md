# Hazard kills kill player

This tutorial will show how to set up a hazard that will restart the scene you are on if the player runs into it, a "Game Over" function.

This tutorial requires you to have read my other tutorial teaching you how to get your character moving as the code responds to Unity's character controller,

## 1. Setting up your Hazards

FIrst thing you will need to do is decide what hazard you want in your game, if you don't already have a sprite or object then you can use a shape in Unity, I will use a cube as my hazard for this tutorial so you can too, place the cube where you'd want it to be in your scene.
