# Hazard kills kill player

This tutorial will show how to set up a hazard that will restart the scene you are on if the player runs into it, a "Game Over" function.

This tutorial requires you to have read other tutorial teaching you how to get your character moving or having your own movement method. You will need to have an open scene as well.

## 1. Setting up your Hazards

FIrst thing you will need to do is decide what hazard you want in your game, if you don't already have a sprite or object then you can use a shape in Unity, I will use a cube as my hazard for this tutorial so you can too, place the cube where you'd want it to be in your scene.
